A few months ago, I was going deer hunting for the first time. Really. For the first time, I was going hunting. To say that I was excited would have been an understatement. I was at my friend's house. While we were getting our gear together, he spotted a doe from the back porch about 80 yards away. My kind friend let me shoot the deer. It ran about 50 yards and then dropped. That was it. Wait, that was it? Hunting is supposed to be this blood pumping, adrenaline flowing exercise, is it not? What about buck fever?

By the time we retrieved the deer, it was past sunset. Too late for my friend to get a deer for himself.

A few days later we were going hunting again. It was just sunset. We were starting to despair of seeing anything. Just when we were about to get down from our perch, seven or eight does emerged from the woods.

"Shoot when you are ready," my friend said as he took the safety off his gun. I immediately shot the closest doe.

"Oh," said my friend, once the sound of the gunshot had died away, and the bouncing white tails of the deer had disappeared. "I thought you would wait a few seconds. I had not gotten a sight picture yet."

And so I had, twice in a row, frustrated the plans of my friend to get a deer.

The next time I went hunting, my friend was not with me, but true to his generous nature, he let me borrow his rifle, and so I set off. I climbed on top of an old oil tank, and got ready for action. Then the waiting game started. I had to out-wait the deer, while hoping the sun would out-wait me.

This would be the last opportunity I would have to go deer hunting until the next season, a year from now. I was determined to make the most of it.

Just before sundown, I saw a huge buck and a doe cross the dam of a pond about 350 yards away. The buck was huge. I didn't have buck tags though, so I tried to get a sight picture on the doe. They were walking fast and I was waiting for the doe to stop. It did not stop though. Soon the doe and buck were back in the woods again. Continuing their happy lives, never even dreaming of the danger they had just escaped. I had failed. I had let that doe go right back to her forage without even firing a shot. That would probably be the last doe I would ever see this year with a gun in my hands. It would certainly be the last doe I would ever see when I could take a legal shot at it. I started to get down from the oil tank.

Suddenly, I saw some rustling in the trees about 150 yards away. I paused. What was that?

It was a deer. And not just one deer, about five or six. And more were coming. They were in the woods now, and I could just barely see them. There was no way I could take a responsible shot at them through the trees. Maybe they would come closer, or better, maybe they would walk out of the woods, jump the fence, and meander out into the field so that I could drop the biggest one.

That seemed unlikely, though. Very unlikely.

But that is exactly what they did.

More and more deer came across the fence and into the field. They started to play with each other in that field. They started to run and jump, frick and frolick, sprint, and suddenly stop. For the first time in my life, I was amazed at the beauty of those deer. Their white tails and graceful strides were enchanting. With the pink and golden beams of color from the sunset behind me glistening off their fur, it was a sight any nature watcher on the planet would have been honored to see through his binoculars. But I was watching them through the scope of a rifle. A Ruger bolt-action rifle that would send a .308 caliber messenger of death screeching, spinning, and whistling towards a pretty fur coat glistening in the sunset; and to what lies behind that coat -- a pair of breathing, pumping, wonderfully created lungs.

For the first time in my life, I had second thoughts about shooting a deer. About shooting any animal for that matter. It seemed almost like a crime against the Creator of nature to disturb such a pretty scene, to disturb such a pretty animal. But it was not. I was not hunting for sport, if I was, it might be. I was hunting for food. My family needed the meat.

BAM!

The beautiful scene exploded, the white tails of the pretty deer shooting off in all directions as if someone blew off a dozen firecrackers underneath a pile of cotton balls.

Suddenly the deer stopped. Most animals will do that, you know. They ran for about thirty yards then stopped, asking themselves the question that was on everyone's mind. What just happened.

I am guessing the older and wiser of the deer didn't stop. I am sure that if I had been an older and wiser deer, I would have made off on the double. But most of the deer did not do that, they just stood around looking at each other.

So I shot another one. Suddenly my fight mode kicked in. I became unconscious of my other surroundings. The deer that had once looked so pretty became ruthless headhunters, or bloodthirsty mob members, or Red invaders. I grit my teeth together, felt the rifle in my hands, embraced the jolt against my shoulder as each round was fired. I re-chambered the rifle with a quickness and precision I had never known before. Pretty soon four deer were on the ground. I was out of bullets.

That was one of the many stories in my life. A snippet of _His_ story. You have a story too, and it should be told.
