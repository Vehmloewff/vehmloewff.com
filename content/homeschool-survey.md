Homeschoolers, as they are called in today's culture, are interesting people.  I don't know if you have met many homeschool students or parents before, but if you have, you would probably agree that they are a very interesting group.  But just how interesting are they?  Lets survey them.

## Questions

When writing out the survey, the toughest decision was deciding which questions to ask, and how to word those questions.  After much thought, and consultation with those wiser than me, I decided to ask the following questions:

### Age and Gender

These are important questions, as they will be some of the ways in which we later sort the results.

### Did your parents divorce?

Do these people answer the other questions differently?

### Animals

Because the the amount and type of animals the person's family owns might be turn out to be an important in the results, I also asked these questions:

> What is the approximate number of pets or farm animals your family owns?

> What type of animals are they: farm animals, pets or both?

### Memory Test

For this, I would read out loud a list of 20 words.  Once I would finish, I'd ask, "Would you like me to repeat the list?"  I would recite the list up to 3 times per individual.

Once finished reciting the list, I would wait for about 30 seconds before requesting that as many of the words on the list that the individual can remember be recited back to me.  The number of words they can recite is their score.

### Screen Time

This is not just phone screen time, it's movies, work on a computer, etc.  In other words, it is the amount of time looking at a screen of any type.

Additionally this is split up into three subcategories.  Screen time at play, work, and school.

### Homeschooled?

Were they homeschooled?

This could potentially be very useful question to ask the parents that are homeschooling their children.

### Eschatology

This question is to determine the religious beliefs of homeschoolers concerning the end times.  I have phrased this as a multiple choice question.

> What would best describe your eschatological views:  Belief in rapture, aumillenial, postmillenial, none of the above, or not sure?

### Number of children wanted

Maybe this will turn out to be something important at analyzation time.  To make things easier, we'll make it multiple choice.

- 0
- 1-2
- 3-5
- 6-10
- 11+

A common answer I got was, "As many as the Lord gives me."  I put all of these down in the `11+` category because their statement is saying that they are fine with that amount.

### Would you homeschool your own children?

Of course, for some of the parents, this will already be evident, but for some of the children this is a great question.

### Do you want to be a 'stay at home' parent?

Well, that's not really the question I asked, but that is what I was really wanting.  To effectively homeschool a child, at least one of the parents will generally have to 'stay at home'.  Does this person want to be that parent, are they hoping that the other parent will want to stay at home, or are they not planning to homeschool their children after all?

The question asked was, "Do you, or do you hope to, work at home, or outside the home?"

## Idea testing

When creating survey, I had a lot of different ideas (about what the results would show).  I'll sho (review) each of the important ones, and [determine] if my idea was correct or not.

First of all, however, lets get an idea of the ages of the people we are analyzing.

### Memory gets drastically worse as age increases.

That is what I thought, but it appears that in the age group I tested, that is not so.

![Age to memory](/assets/age-to-memory.png)

So that idea is still completely **UNSUPPORTED**.

Of course, when a person is much older than 54, the age of the oldest person in this data set, I would assume that memory decreases, but as far as the ages 6-54 go, memory is about even in this data set.

### The people who want to homeschool their children generally want more children.

The average number of children wanted for folks who want to homeschool their children is `6-10`, with the MODE being `11+`.

The average number of children wanted for folks who do not want to homeschool their children is `1-2`, with the MODE being `0`.

So this idea is **SUPPORTED** by this dataset.

These results did take me a bit by surprise, I was expecting a difference between the two modes, but the degree of this difference was something wholly unexpected.

### More screen time correlates to a lower memory score.

I am going to be testing this idea using four different methods.

#### Method 1

The average memory score of people with more than 1.5 hours of screen time at play compared to the average memory score of the remaining group.

7.2 is the average memory score of the folks with more than 1.5 hours of screen time, compared to 7.6, which is the average memory score of everyone else.  That is a small enough difference to indicate that an amount more than 1.5 hours of screen time at play does not either increase or decrease memory retention.

#### Method 2

The average memory score of those with more than 4 hours of screen time compared to the average memory score of the remaining group.

8.3 is the average memory score of people with 4 hours of total screen time or more, compared to 7.1, which is the average memory score of everyone else.  While it may be that more than four hours of screen time is an ingredient to a better memory, I doubt it.  This is more likely explained in that most people in this group are using a screen for homeschooling, and it would make sense that those people would have a better memory, as they are actively being educated.

#### Method 3

A linear graph representing memory scores to screen time at play.

Memory scores are to the side, screen time at play is on the bottom.

![Memory to play screen time](/assets/memory-to-play-screen-time.png)

Interesting.  Not really much evidence to support the idea in there!

#### Method 4

A linear graph representing memory scores over total screen time.

Memory scores are to the side, total screen time is on the bottom.

![Memory to screen time](/assets/memory-to-screen-time.png)

#### Screen time summary

Overall, it appears that my idea is not only completely **UNSUPPORTED**, but if anything, the opposite is supported, as show by the data from methods 1, 2, and 3.

### People that have more animals are more likely to have more children.

I won't even go into the data here.  Before I had even completed running the numbers, it became totally apparent to me that this idea was wholly **UNSUPPORTED**.

## Interesting finds

It appears that 16% of the people surveyed were homeschooled, but do not want to, or don't currently, homeschool their children.  This was rather a surprise to me, I was expecting a much smaller number.

Here is the complete breakdown.

![Homeschooled homeschool](/assets/homeschooled-homeschool.png)

Another thing that I found interesting from the dataset was the amount of people that answered the multiple choice eschatology question with "not sure", 69%.  The number of "not sure" rises to 83% if I include the minors that answered differently than their parents.

Alright, I've left the most mind-blowing discovery for last.  As I mentioned previously, I would recite the memory list up to three times per individual, if the indicated they wanted me to repeat it.

I didn't mark down how many times each person asked me to repeat the list, but I wish I did.  When I was about a half way through collecting data for the survey, it suddenly hit me: *the more more times I repeated a list to an individual, the higher they would score*.  It was almost certain!  It didn't matter how sure they thought they were that they had the list down after the first time, they were practically guaranteed to get beat by the fellow who asked for the list again.

I don't know about you, but I find this so interesting that I would be willing to do another survey on this topic alone.  Sadly however, I don't have time to do that now.  If any of you readers decide to pull it of, [please let me know](/contact).

## Conclusion

I have certainly learned a lot from doing this survey.  I hope you have also benefited from what I have shared with you.  I don't know about you, but this survey has left me with a lot more questions than I had before, such as:

- "How much would a much larger sample size of data change the current results?"  I only surveyed 31 people.  Statistically, that is not enough people to be representative of homeschoolers.
- "Some people claim that homeschoolers are often smarter than public schoolers.  Is this really true?"  A similar study comparing homeschoolers to public schoolers would be interesting.

In the midst of uncertainties, this survey has made one thing certain.  I forgot what that was though...

Maybe I need more screen time...
