Homeschoolers, as they are called in today's culture, are interesting people.  I don't know if you have met many homeschool students or parents before, but if you have, you would probably agree that they are a very interesting pack.  But just how interesting are they?  Lets survey them.

## Questions

When writing out the survey, the question that troubled me most was the question of questions.  Literally, my absolute tallest hurdle was deciding which questions to ask, and how to word those questions.  After much thought, and consultation with those wiser than me, I decided to ask the following questions:

### Age and Gender

These are important questions, as they will be some of the ways in which we later sort the results.

### Did your parents divorce?

Do these people answer the other questions differently?

### Animals

Because the the amount and type of animals the person's family owns might have something to do with the rest of the results, I also asked these questions:

> What is the approximate number of pets or farm animals your family owns?

> What type of animals are they: farm animals, pets or both?

### Memory Test

For this, I read out loud a list of 20 words.  Once I am finished, I'd ask the person, "Would you like me to repeat the list?"  I will repeat the list up to two times if they wish.

Once I am done with reading, I wait for about 30 seconds, the amount of words they remember is their score.

### Screen Time

This is not just phone screen time, it's movies, work on a computer, etc.  In other words, it is the amount of time the person is looking at a screen.

Additionally this is split up into three subcategories.  Screen time at play, work, and school.

### Homeschooled?

A very useful question to ask the parents that are homeschooling their children.  Were they homeschooled?

### Eschatology

### Number of children wanted

Maybe this will turn out to be something important at analyzation time.  To make things easier for the questionee, we'll make it multiple choice.

- 0
- 1-2
- 3-5
- 6-10
- 11+

A common answer I got was, "As many as the Lord gives me."  I put all of these down in the `11+` category because their statement is saying that they are fine with that amount.

### Would you homeschool your own children?

Of course, for some of the parents, this will already be evident, but for some of the children this is a great question.

### Do you want to be a 'stay at home' parent?

Well, that's not really the question I asked, but that is what I was really wanting.  To effectively homeschool a child, at least one of the parents will generally have to 'stay at home'.  Does this person want to be that parent, are they hoping that the other parent will want to stay at home, or are they not planning to homeschool their children after all?

The question asked was, "Do you, or do you hope to, work at home, or outside the home?"

## Idea testing

Going into the work of creating the survey, I had a lot of different ideas.  I'll show each of the important ones, and if my idea was correct or not.

First of all, however, lets get an idea of the ages of the people we are analyzing.

### Memory gets drastically worse as age increases.

That is what I thought, but it appears that in the age group I tested, that is not so.

![Age to memory](/assets/age-to-memory.png)

So that idea is still completely **UNSUPPORTED**.

Of course, when a person is much older than 54, the age of the oldest person in this data set, I would assume that memory decreases, but as far as the ages 6-54 go, memory is about even in this data set.

### The people who want to homeschool their children generally want more children.

The average number of children wanted for folks who want to homeschool their children is `6-10`, with the MODE being `11+`.

The average number of children wanted for folks who do not want to homeschool their children is `1-2`, with the MODE being `0`.

So this idea is **SUPPORTED** by this dataset.

These results did take me a bit by surprise, I was expecting a difference between the two modes, but the greatness of this difference was something wholly unexpected.

### More screen time correlates to a lower memory score.

I am going to be testing this idea using four different methods.

#### Method 1

The average memory score of people with more than 1.5 hours of screen time at play compared to the average memory score of the rest of the people.

7.2 is the average memory score of the folks with more than 1.5 hours of screen time, compared to 7.6, which is the average memory score of everyone else.  That is a small enough difference to indicate that an amount more than 1.5 hours of screen time at play does not either increase or decrease memory retention.

#### Method 2

The average memory score of those with more than 4 hours of screen time compared to the average memory score of the rest of the people.

8.3 is the average memory score of people with 4 hours of total screen time or more, compared to 7.1, which is the average memory score of everyone else.  While it may be that more than four hours of screen time is an ingredient to a better memory, I doubt it.  This is more likely explained in that most people in this group are using a screen for homeschooling, and it would make sense that those people would have a better memory, as they are actively learning lots of things.

#### Method 3

A linear graph representing memory scores to screen time at play.

Memory scores are to the side, screen time at play is on the bottom.

Interesting.  Not really much evidence to support the idea in there!

#### Method 4

A linear graph representing memory scores over total screen.

Memory scores are to th side, total screen time is on the bottom.

#### Overall

Overall, it appears that my idea is not only completely **UNSUPPORTED**, but if anything, the opposite is supported, as show by the data from methods 1, 2, and 3.

### People that have more animals are more likely to have more children.

To save time, I won't even go into the data here.  Before I had even run the numbers much, it became totally apparent to me that this idea was wholly **UNSUPPORTED**.

## Interesting finds

It appears that 16% of the people surveyed were homeschooled, but do not want to, or don't, homeschool their children.  This was rather a surprise to me, I was expecting a much smaller number.

Here is the complete breakdown.

![Homeschooled homeschool](/assets/homeschooled-homeschool.png)

Another thing that I found interesting from the dataset was the amount of people that answered the multiple choice eschatology question with "not sure", 69%.  83% if I count the minors that answered differently than their parents as "not sure" also.

Alright, Ive left the most mind-blowing discovery for last.  Once I would finish reciting words in the memory test to a person, I would ask them, "Do you want me to repeat the list?"  If they said yes, I would repeat it again and ask them if they want me to repeat it again.  I would repeat the list up to three times per individual.

I didn't mark down how many times each person asked me to repeat the list, but I wish I did, because when I was about a half way through collecting data for the survey, it suddenly hit me: *the more more times I repeated a list to someone, the higher score they would get*.  It was almost certain!  It didn't matter how sure they thought they were that they had the list down after the first time, they were practically guaranteed to get beat by the fellow who asked for the list again.

I don't know about you, but this is such an interesting find to me that I would be willing to do another survey just on that.  Sadly however, I don't have time to do that now.  If any of you readers decide to pull it of, [please let me know](/contact).

## Conclusion

I have certainly learned a lot of things from doing this survey.  I hope you have also learned a lot from what I have shared with you.  I don't know about you, but this survey has left me with a lot more questions than I had before, such as:

- "How much would a much larger amount of data change the current results?"  I only surveyed 31 people.  Statistically, that is not enough people to really represent a majority.
- "Some people claim that homeschoolers are often smarter the government schoolers.  Is this really true?"  Maybe we could do something like the memory test used in this survey, but probably we would need something a little more geared to brain power.

Well folks, goodbye for now ðŸ‘‹.  In the midst of a world of uncertainties, of one thing I can be certain (among others), no matter how interesting I thought homeschoolers were before, I believe they are a good deal more interesting now.
