### The Question

The other day, a wise old man asked me a very good question.

> Was Booker T. Washington's method for racial acceptance an elitist program?

After some thought, I found an answer to the question -- two of them actually. Yes, and no.

### A Bit of Background

Booker T. Washington was a former slave who dedicated his life in the purpose of dissolving the racial tensions in the United States caused by the Reconstruction.

He explains all about his method for gaining racial acceptance in his autobiography, _Up from Slavery_, and in his 1886 Atlanta Address. However, it can easily be summarized in one word. **Work**. If you are at the bottom of society (like the majority of blacks in his day were), work your way up. Pretty soon the whites will see what a valuable place you hold in society. If they haven't already accepted you, they will then. Everyone wants to be the friend of a successful businessman.

Booker T. Washington organized a college where he taught these principles. But he didn't just teach principles. He taught industry. Literally. Students were taught how to make bricks (really dirty work), furniture, and houses by doing it -- over and over again. As a result, they often developed a very strong work ethic and high character code.

### The Answer

So, is the method Washington proposed an elitist method? Well, on it's cover, no.

You see, at that time most of the blacks were all fluffed up over the fact that some states were passing laws against the intermingling of the races. One of these laws said that blacks were not allowed to go to opera houses. Washington's program basically just said, "Stop using up your time dreaming about spending a dollar at the opera house, and start using your time to make an extra dollar." That requires character, commitment, and hard work.

Does that mean followers of the program can't become elite? I don't think so. In fact I think that's really the point of the program. You can and should be the best at what you do. You can and should put your God-given brains to work at finding creative ways to increase the quality of your product or service. You can and should harness the power of the wind, the sun, and technology to make your production chain more efficient. Some of the blacks of his day did this. Their names have gone down in history as masters of what they did -- hard-working individuals who really went _Up from Slavery_. Elites. Washington's program did this to them.

I don't know about you, but I'd say that the program that makes elites is one of the most elite programs out there. Even if it involves getting your hands dirty. Literally.
