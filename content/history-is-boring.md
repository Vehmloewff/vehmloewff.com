This happened, then this happened, which led to this, and then that.  Then this happened, then that, which, of course, led to that.  I don't know about you, but I am already starting to get bored.  It feels like that old history class my grandma told me about, with the sneering, spectacled teacher going over event after event in the most monotonous tone imaginable.

Many in this day and age are ignorant about history, despite the fact that in most schools, it is being shoved at them for the greater part of ages five to eighteen.  If history wasn't boring, high school graduates would know as much about it as they do their favorite video game, or their favorite sport, or whatever else they find interesting.  There is no doubt.  Today, history is boring.

When history is a series of meaningless events dictating the outcome of a random universe, history is more than boring.  It is meaningless.  If history had meaning, it would be considered a counselor for the future.  If history had meaning, it wouldn't be boring.

If history is meaningless, life is meaningless, and nothing has meaning.  The sun comes up, and it goes down.  It does so while meaningless events take place, then we die, and another meaningless generation arises, spending their lives causing meaningless problems for themselves, killing each other over petty disputes, and then to die.  This cycle has no end to its meaninglessness.  Whatever a person accomplishes in life, it is out of his control after his death.  The person after him may undo whatever he has done.  All of life is meaningless, from conception to death.  Everything a person does from his dusty and insignificant beginning, through his dirty and thorn-torn life, to his dreadful end is meaningless, whether pleasure, achievement of fleeting goals, or sustained difficulties.  Without God, man speeds towards his depressing end.

There is, however, a God in the heavens.  A God of meaning, the only source of true meaning.  This God is saving people from their lives of meaninglessness and adopting them as His children.  He gives their lives a true meaning, living for Him.  This God also cares about every little thing about every one of His children, ordaining every event in the lives of His children for their own good, which is ultimately, to glorify Himself.

From this perspective, life is very meaningful.

From the perspective of a meaningful life, history blossoms with meaning.  If the purpose of every one of God's children is to glorify God, each of God's children will endeavor to show others the figurative Door of Meaning, by which anyone can become God's child, causing more people to glorify God.  If God works out meaning in the lives of many, and works out events to point people to the Door of Meaning over many generations, multi-generational events have meaning, and God-centered history is meaningful.

If God-centered history is meaningful, it is not boring.  Nothing truly meaningful is truly boring.  Anything that impacts the creation and circumstances of a meaningful life is full of excitement.

History can be taught from one of two perspectives.  Either it is taught from a meaningless man-centered perspective that is boring to the core, or it is taught from a meaningful God-centered perspective that highlights the excitement of God glorifying Himself, bringing all events together for the good of His children, and the steady and unstoppable increasing of His family through His Children.  God is the only source of meaning in this universe, and He gives undeniable meaning to this story of life He is writing.  History is boring, but HIStory is the most exciting story written.
