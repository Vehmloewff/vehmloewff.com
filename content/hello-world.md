Hello there! It's nice to have a blog, especially one that supports code blocks...

```ts
import { getViewingUser } from 'facebook-and-google'

const user = getViewingUser()
const channel = user.openSpywareChannel('ensure-user-views-latest-posts')

channel.activateAndSpy()
```

... because that is very important to me.

You know, it's amazingly nice to have a blog and all, but you know what is even more amazing? The fact that you are reading it! Yep! So I guess I'll just give you another nice, polite, `Hello ${user.name()}!` before you kindly go check out some of my [latest posts](/blog). See ya!
