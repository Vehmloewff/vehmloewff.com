Yes, he most certainty was.  I don't know why he thought he wasn't.  For starters he ate rice.  Rice.  Rice that he didn't grow.  Rice that was probably grown somewhere in Asia or Louisiana where expert rice farmers toiled away at their fields.  These rice farmers, being hard workers, likely required more than just rice to eat, and so they would have bought beef, pork, or lamb at the market in town.  These same rice farmers would have then sold their rice at the market, where it, along with the meat the rice farmer bought, helps to feed the carpenter that built the market stalls and carts.  Some merchant then came to the market in the town where the rice farmers lived, and bought them, selling his shipment of goods that were produced elsewhere in the world - in little towns, each with their own markets, restaurants and pubs, and their own set of carpenters that depend on beef, corn, and the blacksmiths to make their tools, who also depend on beef, corn, and possibly, rice.

The rice was then probably transported across the world in large merchant ships, their ropes and sails probably manufactured by experts in their trade in London, Plymouth, Salem, Philadelphia, or another bustling port town that had it's own market and detailed division of labor.

Then another merchant bought a portion of the rice and transported it deep inland and put it up for sale in the local Concord market, where David Thoreau happened to be that day, who bought the bag of rice, slug it over his shoulder, and trotted back to his "Shack in the Woods", still thinking that he was independent from the "the division of labor and it's evils".

By just buying that bag of rice from the Concord market, Thoreau had made use of almost every niche in the division of labor.  From the shipbuilders who built the merchant ship that transported the rice, to the shoemakers that made shoes for the shipbuilders, to the doctors that cared for both the shoemakers and shipbuilders, to the coopers that made the barrels that transported the life supporting fresh water for the sailors of the merchant ship.  And the sailors!  What about all the french winemakers and vineyard tenders that sold the wine to the smugglers that sneaked it across the channel into Weymouth or Gravesend, who sold their wine to the pub owners, who then sold it to the sailors along with a meal, provided by farmers and another set of merchants?

No, David Thoreau was quite dependent on the division of labor - and I haven't even started to talk about the tailor that made the clothes on his back that kept him warm enough to be strong enough to carry that bag of rice back to his "Shack in the Woods" so he could be warm and fed during the long winter where he devoted his time to musing about his independence from the division of labor.
